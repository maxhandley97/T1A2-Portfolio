                    I was born and did my schooling in Coffs Harbour, to an American Father and German Mother. Leading me to have a multi-cultured upbringing and the benefit of having multiple passports.

                    My childhood interests were adrenaline and sports, trying almost every sport but having to limit myself to basketball, rowing, downhill skateboarding and surfing.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    When I finished school, I focused on travelling up until the pandemic.

                    The recent pandemic brought me back to Australia, choosing to base myself down the road, in the Mullumbimby Area.
