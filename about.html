                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born in Coffs Harbour on the 30th of May, 1997. <br> My german mother ensured a multi-lingual upbringing and the benefit of multiple passports made me yearn to use them, which was my main goal after completing secondry education in Coffs Harbour.
                    My childhood interests can be summed up with sports, trying almost every sport but having to limit myself to basketball, rowing, downhill skateboarding and surfing.
                <br>
                    When I finished school, I focused on travelling up until the pandemic.
                    Covid brought me back to Australia, choosing to base myself down the road from where I grew up, in the Mullumbimby Area.
