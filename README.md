## Purpose 
The purpose of my website is to give future employers and potential future clients an opportunity to get to know who I am, my history and where I'm from, as well as present my novice skills (at this stage) in crafting their future website.

## Functionality and Features
The website has 9 linked components that are accessable by using the navigation bar, fixed to the top of the viewport.
There is a landing page, a page dedicated to getting to know me, a blog navigation page and a contact list. The blog navigation page links the user to multiple blog pages, in which they can read the complete articles in a seperate page.

There are multiple clickable icons within the pages that link the site to its many components, embedded documents and my relevant pages on various professional and social media platforms. These interact with the user when hovered over to display they are links.

The website scales down so that viewers on phones and tablets can navigate easily and it is accessible and simple to vision impared viewers on any device they choose to view it on.
